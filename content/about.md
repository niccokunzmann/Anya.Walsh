![](/img/about-anya.jpg)

i'm Anya. I am a Temple Priestess, Sacred Sexuality, Somatic Embodiment & Women's work Space-holder, Vocal Reiki Healer, Yoga Teacher, Ceremonial Dancer, Sound Healing Practitioner and Artist.

My passions weave through in a variety of ways, I believe in full expression of life without apology. In power of expression channelled through our life force, Eros, to be expressed in creativity and sexuality that is felt in every moment, every sensation, every experience. 

I am extremely passionate about providing spaces that encourage empowering self on individual's own healing journey and giving the tools to do so, and encouraging methods and insights into cultivating our life force energy and the love that brings for self and all around and reigniting that power within us that has been shamed and suppressed, and regenerating energy within us for our better health, greater personal power, greater pleasure in all of life's experiences.

I have been holding retreats and workshops for 5 years, collaborated with many talented facilitators across West Wales and Glastonbury, and holding workshops, yoga classes and Temples at festivals around the UK. Before this I travelled across the world for years on a journey of deep healing, gaining insights into the world and humanity, and self inquiry whilst acquiring skills and wisdom from multiple schools of the celtic isles and lands from across the seas.
