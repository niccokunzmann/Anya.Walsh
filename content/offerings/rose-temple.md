## What is the The Rose Temple?

The Rose Temple is a ceremonially held shared journey where we meet in heart, in desire, in pleasure, in emotion, in vulnerability, in connection, in the intimacy of all that arises in sacred space.  The Rose holds us in her heart, taking us on a journey to witness our own and others true essence, and in connection with our hearts and loving consensual touch. 

The Rose embodies unfolding the delicacy of our pleasure, emotion, our desires, our boundaries, our vulnerabilities, our challenges, our pleasure, our expression. And it is a gentle slow unfurling, at a different pace for each individual for where you're at in your journey. 

This is a deeply healing transformational journey that ignites more power, courage, self-assurance and expression into your life in many ways. Our sexual expression that has been repressed is our life force, which is entwined with our creative expression which is our natural flowing expressive energy in many more ways than a paintbrush on paper. It connects us to the core of our being, the core of all nature, there is a power and mystery that unfolds that ia greater than the human mind can comprehend. 

Within the exploration of deep sensuality arises sexual energy, and this is a beautiful and natural element of our being - it is our life force, our very power that drives us, ignites our passion and our souls. We welcome the beauty it carries whilst welcoming for that energy to flow into our entire being to not be limited to our sacral or genitalia.​

We invite in our pleasure in deeper ways to a richer and fuller experience first by accepting ourselves as sexual beings to realise that everything in life is sex, as we recognise everything is enveloped in our life force energy, our sexual energy, so that every breath, every sound, every movement, every sensation is a pleasurable intimate dance with our inner lover. We open our pleasure and sensations to allow this experience to unfold in the The Rose Temple to invite this more into our daily lives.

> "It surprised me how open and vulnerable I felt able to be, completely opening to the love and sensation and how strange how completely normal this feels and then how abnormal it makes out there in the world"

> "The session really surprised me in terms of how quickly I felt comfortable, safe and relaxed, but at the same time it was really invigorating and empowering to feel connected to people through touch, as a form of intimacy that we hardly ever use outside of romantic or sexual situations with people we are close too. I felt supported, and like we were all existing on the same wavelength of empathy, care, embodiment and the desire for closer connections. I came away from the session feeling peaceful, blissful and electrified :) thank you !!"

Each Temple is entirely different, you will never have the same experience twice, even if you came to every single Temple. But a typical structure of our Temple of Love looks like this:

Agreements for creating a safe container

Opening Ritual, opening into sounds and movement of our sensual being

- Walkabout connection games

- Exercises for learning & establishing Boundaries & Consent

- Facilitated exercises for connection in physical contact or energetic (option for non-physical contact), opening our sensual experience 

- Full circle check in 

- Deeper, richer exercises dropping deeper into our embodied experience 

- Opening to free space - check in beforehand and establishing boundaries & how to take care of yourself and others.

- Closing circle, integration, aftercare & expression of words and sounds to close our experience individually and as a collective

​

Held in a new beautiful wooden cabin with gorgeous views for our evening Temple for a nourishing cosy safe container

​

This is a clothing optional space as our human bodies are beautiful and we wish to welcome and celebrate our bodies. However for holding a safe container, we hold a boundary of this being a pants on space (all genders) for ensuring no skin to skin genital contact. It is non-penetrative space in any means of penetrating genitals so this pants on boundary enables that an easy way to hold that safely for everyone. Full nudity is allowed within sauna/hot tub experiences where that contained experience is a non-sexual space. 

Come however makes you feel most comfortable and empowered, whether that is casual clothing, sexy clothing, smart clothing, underwear - it is all beautiful

 

This event is open for individuals, couples, lovers, friends, female bodied, male bodied, non-binary/other-gender bodied. 

 

We'd like this to be available for all, get in touch if you feel called.

Key information for your safety

​

This is a sober space, please do not consume drugs or alcohol before or during this event, it is important for everyone to be in full sober awareness of their bodily experience

This is a trauma aware space, facilitators and spaceholders assisting are available to support your needs during exercises and free space. It is your responsibility to take care of yourself - that includes seeking support when support or sitting out of exercises when needed. We use cards to signal if you need support, often we know we need something but it's hard to find what so given these options supports to finding what feels right when something is triggered

> "I felt very relaxed and safe enough to drop my guard and enjoy some lovely, nourishing connection and gentle touch with others in the group. This was because the space was held so beautifully, with sensitivity, kindness and clarity, always giving me the freedom to choose for myself how much i wanted to explore each practice, with myself or others" - Katie
