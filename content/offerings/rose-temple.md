## What is the The Rose Temple?

The Rose Temple is a ceremonially held shared journey where we meet in heart, in desire, in pleasure, in emotion, in vulnerability, in connection, in the intimacy of all that arises in sacred space.  The Rose holds us in her heart, taking us on a journey to witness our own and others true essence, and in connection with our hearts and loving consensual touch. 

The Rose Temple is a unique offeing, with it's foundation embedded in awareness, listening and responding to your nervous system. The space is guided with care and gentleness to support you to listen to what's arising for you, and within this holding feeling more able to respond to your needs. 

The Rose embodies unfolding the delicacy of our pleasure, emotion, our desires, our boundaries, our vulnerabilities, our challenges, our pleasure, our expression. And it is a gentle slow unfurling, at a different pace for each individual for where you're at in your journey. 

This is a deeply healing transformational journey that ignites more power, courage, self-assurance and expression into your life in many ways. Our sexual expression that has been repressed is our life force, which is entwined with our creative expression which is our natural flowing expressive energy in many more ways than a paintbrush on paper. It connects us to the core of our being, the core of all nature, there is a power and mystery that unfolds that ia greater than the human mind can comprehend. 

Within the exploration of deep sensuality arises sexual energy, and this is a beautiful and natural element of our being - it is our life force, our very power that drives us, ignites our passion and our souls. We welcome the beauty it carries whilst welcoming for that energy to flow into our entire being to not be limited to our sacral or genitalia.​

We invite in our pleasure in deeper ways to a richer and fuller experience first by accepting ourselves as sexual beings to realise that everything in life is sex, as we recognise everything is enveloped in our life force energy, our sexual energy, so that every breath, every sound, every movement, every sensation is a pleasurable intimate dance with our inner lover. We open our pleasure and sensations to allow this experience to unfold in the The Rose Temple to invite this more into our daily lives.

> "It surprised me how open and vulnerable I felt able to be, completely opening to the love and sensation and how strange how completely normal this feels and then how abnormal it makes out there in the world"

> "The session really surprised me in terms of how quickly I felt comfortable, safe and relaxed, but at the same time it was really invigorating and empowering to feel connected to people through touch, as a form of intimacy that we hardly ever use outside of romantic or sexual situations with people we are close too. I felt supported, and like we were all existing on the same wavelength of empathy, care, embodiment and the desire for closer connections. I came away from the session feeling peaceful, blissful and electrified :) thank you !!"

There is guided practices to introduce boundaries and consent and how to engage with one another in physical touch in a way that feels safe and wholesome, and a facilitated journey of coming into our sensual experience with ourselves and each other then when we open up into open space there is defined areas for you to flow into where you feels your needs align as much as those needs change with softer levels of 

 intimacy & connection or more sensually arousing touch, always with an option to connect only with yourself as much as you need to​

​

Each Temple is entirely different, you will never have the same experience twice, even if you came to every single Temple. But a typical structure of our Temple of Love looks like this:

- Agreements for creating a safe container

- Opening Ritual, opening into sounds and movement of our sensual being

- Self connection, self-love & nervous system resourcing practices 

- Exercises for embodied listening of your Boundaries & Consent

- Facilitated exercises for connection in physical contact or energetic (option for non-physical contact), opening our sensual experience 


- Opening to free space - where we integrate and explore what we have learnt so far with others. Emotional support available from facilitators & assistants. 

- Closing circle, integration, aftercare 


 

This event is open for individuals, couples, lovers, friends, female bodied, male bodied, non-binary/other-gender bodied.

> "I felt very relaxed and safe enough to drop my guard and enjoy some lovely, nourishing connection and gentle touch with others in the group. This was because the space was held so beautifully, with sensitivity, kindness and clarity, always giving me the freedom to choose for myself how much i wanted to explore each practice, with myself or others" - Katie
