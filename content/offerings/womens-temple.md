As we enter the bosom of her Rose Temple, we journey to remember the ways we women used to honour, touch, love, celebrate one another in the ancient ways. 

We hold the capacity to feel the delicious arousal in every part of our being, of the Divine Feminine that flows through us, through the portal of our womb... 
We call for our body come alive in remembrance, reclaiming our sovereign current of eros... Our heart softly opening to deep receptivity of all life... We unravel the nuances of how the lines of sexuality and sensuality within sisterhod and lovers are not so black and white. 

Together, we awaken the remembrance of who we truly are: goddess, priestess, well maiden, mother of creation, wise woman.
In this mirror of eachother, you are reflected in all your archetypal power—erotic, innocent, powerful, radiant, and rooted.

Our sensuality as women is powerful and magick, and we have been conditioned to suppress or shame it but it is our sensual nature with the wisdom of our womb that brings great power and knowing.
Our sexuality as yoni-holders is a rich delicacy of feminine touch thats graced with the sacred current of eros that flows through our feminine essence. This divine energy connects us to each other, to the Earth, and to the Great Mysteries—inviting us to soften, to recieve, and to remember.

## What will this bring into your life?

Being in touch with our sexual expression ignites our power, our passion, our sovereignty, connects us deeply to ourselves, our needs, our desires, nature and our senses in a much fuller richer way. It is our Eros, our force of nature that lies within us, it is integral to the fullness of our being, and that is exactly why for millenia it has been suppressed, shamed and dirtied. But it is the most beautiful, powerful thing you have access to in your life - and it is right within you. 

​

We open a space to be able to open, feel into this energy in a held container in the safety of sisterhood. To witness ourselves and each other tuning into this energy.

​

Pleasure is available in every moment, every sensation, every breath - if we allow ourselves to access that pleasure. Pleasure does not need to be sought from another person, although there is great beauty in that too, when we can fully experience pleasure in our sensual bodies no matter where we are, then we can experience even fuller pleasure with another when we reunite. 

​

The dance with our inner lover, meeting her/them and fully embracing to be reunited after so long is a magical, beautiful experience. Making love with our inner lover with the kiss of a cherry, with the kiss of our breath, our sacred touch - brings her, and therefore you, alive. All the magic, love, pleasure you can bring to yourself. 

- From allowing our sexual energy to be felt and expressed through the simplest of ways such as movement, sound, breath, our creative expression unfolds deeper

- Increase your personal power, authority, sovereignty

- Increase the pleasure in your life for yourself in the everyday and in intimacy both with yourself and your lover

- Love the parts of you that have been difficult to love

- Experience the expansive journey of how breath can weave between pleasure and healing and unite the two 

- Be witnessed in your true beauty and your insecurity, as you witness our sisterhood in the same

- Open your vocal to sacral channel, opening your vocal expression, womb expression, and all the power, intuition, insight it beholds
