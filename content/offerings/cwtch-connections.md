## Bring in more connection into your life

Do you long to feel held?

To feel connected in a way that feels safe and nourishing?

To express your needs and find a way they can be met?


Nourishing touch & cuddles can feel scary with strangers, but we gently open to connection gentle step at a time at your own pace doing only what feels really nourishing for you

This is a trauma-aware space as trained by Eshana Spiers, where we our regulating our nervous systems and you are held in your experience in what arises for you

## The Workshop

We set agreements to open a safe container where everyone's voice and needs feel respected and valued

Step by step you are guided to gently guided into this safe container, firstly connecting to ourselves, then connecting to other participants in authentic expression of emotion and desires with non-physical contact. 

As and when you're ready, you're invited in for ways to bring in gentle touch in embodied learning of boundaries and consent.

in groups, we open ways to align our own desires for touch with others that long for a similar level of contact. 

The workshop ends in a group sharing of cuddles before closing the space and the journey we've shared together.

Everything is an invitation, the workshop is guided so that wherever on the scale of intimacy (within this non-sexual space) you desire then that can be met - and that includes options given for non-physical contact or limited contact throughout the workshop.

## What is it?

- It is a space for platonic touch
- It is a space to receive touch, connection in a way that feels safe and nourishing for you
- It is a space to practice embodied listening of what you want, what you don't want, and what you're needing in each moment - if this is new this can take time to learn how to listen
- It is a space for learning - of yourself, your body's awareness, practicing communicating needs, your boundaries etc
- It is a space to respect yours and others YES's and NO's 
- It is a space to feel deeply nourished, safe, regulated.
- It is a space not to overextend yourself - only doing in the space what feels comfortable for you, not going beyond that. Staying in non-physical contact is entirely possible whilst still participating and receiving. There's a sweet spot of stretch - just like Yoga, we want to stretch the muscle, the comfort zone, just a little for what feels good and will grow that muscle of learning but overstretching will only harm the muscle. 

## What is it NOT?

- It is not a sexual space. Sexuality is a beautiful thing, but in this space we bring any sexual energy back into fully embodied heart space - not firing up the eros 
- it is not a hook-up space 
- It is not a free flow space to move into cuddling upon arrival or at any point outside of an invited exercise 
- There are a set of agreements we will run through around confidentiality, honouring consent and boundaries, holding non-sexual energy, and a drug and alcohol free space
