I hold online working group sessions - The Eros Embodiment Group - that is a community working group coming together to journey as an individual and with the collective. You can come to one session or every session, as suits you. Every month we work with something different, no two sessions the same. There is a theme for what feels right for the session, and that is also responsive and fluid to meet the needs of the group that attend. 



Below are what sessions can involve, which could be a large focus on one of them, multiple or sometimes weaving all of them together. These containers are empowering your sacred self pleasure, to feel alive and safe within your own body, your nervous system, your pleasure in this online circle. 

For example, a container might be about Energygasms; Deepening Embodied Self Love; Embodiment Resourcing; Opening your Sacral to Vocal Channel..... and so much more!!

​
This circle is open to all genders, sexual orientations and relationship statuses.

## Your Eros

We journey to awaken, empower, enliven your life force, your sekhem, your prana, your eros. This powerful force of energy has many names across many traditions and ancient cultures - it is the source of all life, the source of our expression, our creative fire. Yet it has been shamed, suppressed and misunderstood for thousands of years. We change the story within our body, we reclaim our body, our power, our story and rewrite our future.

## Your Breath

Your breath is the most powerful tools you have access to - and you have access to it, you use it every single moment. And because we use it every single moment we take it for granted, forgetting it is a vessel for transformation. We can change our state of being at any moment just with our breath - to energise, to relax, to reset our nervous system, to release stuck energies...

## Your Sound

Your sound is sacred. Each person's sound, each moment of your sound is unique in frequency and has the power to heal, to transform yourself and others. 

Expression through our vocals stimulates our vagus nerve, and therefore aids our nervous system into parasympathetic states. Our vocal chords connect to our sacral centre - activating the sacral to vocal channel allows our life force energy to flow and be expressed, to awaken in all of our body, for a pathway for our kundalini energy to arise. 

## Somatic Movement

When activated in a sympathetic state movement is needed to circulate and release stuck energy, which allows us to settle into a neutral regulated state again.

## Embodiment & Resourcing

Dropping into our somatic experience, being curious about what we find, we can notice sensations, feelings we otherwise might overlook.

We can also find resource in our body, regulate our nervous system and experience greater relaxation, contentment, and safety. 

## Nervous System Regulation

We start with practices to ground into the space, regulate as only from a regulated state can we go on a journey of deep discovery. I am a Trauma Informed Space-holder that responds to the needs of the group, and pulls upon various practices that are right for the moment

## More Dates Coming Soon!
