description: The Rose Temple is a ceremonially held shared journey where we meet in heart, in desire, in pleasure, in emotion, in vulnerability, in connection, in the intimacy of all that arises in sacred space.  The Rose holds us in her heart, taking us on a journey to witness our own and others true essence, and in connection with our hearts and loving consensual touch.
